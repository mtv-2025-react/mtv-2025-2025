## Acknowledgement

This project is built upon the open-source work of [baseline_react2025](https://github.com/reactmultimodalchallenge/baseline_react2025). We sincerely thank the authors for their contributions and making their code publicly available. Our work extends and adapts their implementation for further research.

## Usage

1. **Dataset and Environment Setup**  
   Please first follow the instructions from [baseline_react2025](https://github.com/reactmultimodalchallenge/baseline_react2025) to complete the following configurations:
   - Dataset download and directory organization.
   - Python environment setup (including dependencies).
   - Download and placement of required files.

2. **Set Pre-trained Model Paths**  
   Before running the code, please modify the following file to specify the paths to your pre-trained  VEATIC weights:
   - **Code A**: `framework/modules/emotion_autoencoder.py`  

3. **Run Training or Inference**  
  The training and inference procedures are the same as in PerFRDiff. Please refer to the[PerFRDiff](https://github.com/reactmultimodalchallenge/baseline_react2025) for commands and usage examples.
